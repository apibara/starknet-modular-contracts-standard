# StarkNet Modular Contracts (SMC) Standard

This repository presents a way to build and deploy modular StarkNet contracts.
It is heavily inspired by the [Diamond Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535), but uses a different naming convention to avoid confusion.

## Running

You can use nile to compile the smart contracts:

```bash
nile compile
```

You can use pytest to runs the tests:

```bash
pytest
```
